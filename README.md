[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/curso-r/auth0.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/curso-r/auth0) [![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/curso-r/auth0?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/curso-r/auth0) [![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/auth0)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=auth0)


The goal of auth0 is to implement an authentication scheme to Shiny using 
OAuth Apps through the freemium service [Auth0](https://auth0.com).

## Installation

You can install auth0 from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("curso-r/auth0")
```

## Auth0 Configuration

Auth0 is an external service so you should create an account there. To create your authenticated shiny app, you should follow the five steps below.

### Step 1: Create an Auth0 account

- Go to [auth0.com](https://auth0.com)
- Click "Sign Up"
- You can create an account placing user name and password or simply signing with your github account.

### Step 2: Create an Auth0 application

After logging in Auth0, you will see a page like this:

<img src="man/figures/README-dash.png">

- Click on "+ New Application"
- Give a name to your app
- Select "Regular Web Applications" and click "Choose"

### Step 3: Configure your application

- Go to the Settings in your selected application. You should see a page like this:

<img src="man/figures/README-myapp.png">

- Add `http://localhost:8100` to the "Allowed Callback URLs", "Allowed Web Origins" and "Allowed Logout URLs".
    - You can change `http://localhost:8100` to another port or the remote server you are going to deploy your shiny app. Just make sure that these addresses are correct. If you are placing your app inside a folder (e.g. https://johndoe.shinyapps.io/fooBar), don't include the folder (`fooBar`) in "Allowed Web Origins".
- Click "Save"

Now let's go to R!

### Step 4: Create your shiny app and populate `_auth0.yml` file

- Create a configuration file for your shiny app, using `auth0::use_auth0()`:

```r
auth0::use_auth0()
```

- You can set the directory where this file will be created using the `path=` parameter. See `?use_auth0` for details.
- Your `_auth0.yml` file should be like this:


```yml
name: myApp
shiny_config:
  local_url: http://localhost:8100
  remote_url: ''
auth0_config:
  api_url: !expr paste0('https://', Sys.getenv("AUTH0_USER"), '.auth0.com')
  credentials:
    key: !expr Sys.getenv("AUTH0_KEY")
    secret: !expr Sys.getenv("AUTH0_SECRET")
```

- Include these information (with quotes): 
  - `api_url`: Your account at Auth0 (e.g. https://jonhdoe.auth0.com). It is the "Domain" in Auth0 application settings. 
  - `credentials`: Your credentials to access Auth0 API, including
    - `key`: the Client ID in Auth0 application settings.
    - `secret`: the Client Secret in Auth0 application settings.
- Save the `_auth0.yml` file
- Write a simple shiny app in a `app.R` file, like this:

```r
library(shiny)

ui <- bootstrapPage(
  fluidRow(plotOutput("plot"))
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    plot(1:10)
  })
}

# note that here we're using a different version of shinyApp!
auth0::shinyAuth0App(ui, server)
```

### Step 5: Run!

You can try your app running

```r
shiny::runApp("app/directory/", port = 8100)
```

If everything is OK, you should be forwarded to a login page and, after logging in or signing up, you'll be redirected to your app. Yay!

## Managing users

You can manage user access from the Users panel in Auth0. To create an user, simply click on "+ Create users".

You can also use many OAuth providers like Google, Facebook, Github etc. To configure them, just go to Connections tab. 

In the near future, our plan is to implement Auth0's API in R so that you can manage your app using R.

## Environment variables

You can use environment variables to populate the `_auth0.yml` file automatically. To do so, you can create a `.Renviron` file in your project root or your user home directory. For example, my `.Renviron` file looks like this:

```
AUTH0_USER=jtrecenti
AUTH0_KEY=5wugt0W...
AUTH0_SECRET=rcaJ0p8...
```

More about environment variables [here](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#renviron).

## Logout

There is a way to add a logout button to your app using [`shinyjs`](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs) package. There is a small example here:

```r
library(shiny)
library(auth0)
library(shinyjs)

# configuration file generated by auth0::use_auth0()
# set as global variable
config_file <<- "_auth0.yml"

# simple UI with action button
# note that you must include shinyjs::useShinyjs() for this to work
ui <- fluidPage(shinyjs::useShinyjs(), actionButton("logout_auth0", "Logout"))

# server with one observer that logouts
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  observeEvent(input$logout_auth0, {
    # javascript code redirecting to correct url
    js <- auth0::auth0_logout_url(config_file)
    shinyjs::runjs(js)
  })
}

auth0::shinyAuth0App(ui, server, config_file)
```

## Costs

Auth0 is a freemium service. The free account lets you have up to 1000 connections in one month and two types of social connections. You can check all the plans [here](https://auth0.com/pricing).
